# vRealize Orchestrator Encryption Plugin

An inventory-less vRO plugin to provide Encoding, Digest, Cipher, and RSA Encryption.

When an integration or automation project needed some encryption, we typically used either CryptoJS or JSEncrypt on top of the Rhino Javascript runtime.

This provides similar methods, is compatible with binary data and is exponentially faster.
